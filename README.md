REGULATION (EC) No 1013/2006 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

of 14 June 2006

on shipments of waste

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1)
The main and predominant objective and component of this Regulation is the protection of the environment, its effects on international trade being only incidental.
(2)
Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community (3) has already been significantly amended on several occasions and requires further amendment. It is necessary, in particular, to incorporate in that Regulation the content of Commission Decision 94/774/EC of 24 November 1994 concerning the standard consignment note referred to in Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 (4) and of Commission Decision 1999/412/EC of 3 June 1999 concerning a questionnaire for the reporting obligation of Member States pursuant to Article 41(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 (5). Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 should therefore be replaced in the interests of clarity.
(3)
Council Decision 93/98/EEC (6) concerned the conclusion, on behalf of the Community, of the Basel Convention of 22 March 1989 on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal (7), to which the Community has been a Party since 1994. By adopting Regulation (EEC) No 259/93, the Council has established rules to curtail and to control such movements designed, inter alia, to make the existing Community system for the supervision and control of waste movements comply with the requirements of the Basel Convention.
(4)
Council Decision 97/640/EC (8) concerned the approval, on behalf of the Community, of the amendment to the Basel Convention, as laid down in Decision III/1 of the Conference of the Parties. By that amendment, all exports of hazardous waste destined for disposal from countries listed in Annex VII to the Convention to countries not listed therein were prohibited, as were, with effect from 1 January 1998, all such exports of the hazardous waste referred to in Article 1(1)(a) of the Convention and destined for recovery. Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 was amended accordingly by Council Regulation (EC) No 120/97 (9).
(5)
In view of the fact that the Community has approved Decision C(2001)107/Final of the OECD Council concerning the revision of Decision C(92)39/Final on the control of transboundary movements of wastes destined for recovery operations (OECD Decision), in order to harmonise waste lists with the Basel Convention and revise certain other requirements, it is necessary to incorporate the content of that Decision in Community legislation.
(6)
The Community has signed the Stockholm Convention of 22 May 2001 on persistent organic pollutants.
(7)
It is important to organise and regulate the supervision and control of shipments of waste in a way which takes account of the need to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and human health and which promotes a more uniform application of the Regulation throughout the Community.
(8)
It is also important to bear in mind the requirement laid down in Article 4(2)(d) of the Basel Convention that shipments of hazardous waste are to be reduced to a minimum, consistent with environmentally sound and efficient management of such waste.
(9)
Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind the right of each Party to the Basel Convention, pursuant to Article 4(1) thereof, to prohibit the import of hazardous waste or of waste listed in Annex II to that Convention.
(10)
Shipments of waste generated by armed forces or relief organisations should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation when imported into the Community in certain situations (including transit within the Community when the waste enters the Community). The requirements of international law and international agreements should be respected in relation to such shipments. In such cases, any competent authority of transit and the competent authority of destination in the Community should be informed in advance concerning the shipment and its destination.
(11)
It is necessary to avoid duplication with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption (10), which already contains provisions covering the overall consignment, channelling and movement (collection, transport, handling, processing, use, recovery or disposal, record keeping, accompanying documents and traceability) of animal by-products within, into and out of the Community.
(12)
The Commission should report by the date of entry into force of this Regulation on the relationship between the existing sectoral legislation on animal and public health and the provisions of this Regulation, and should submit by that date any proposals needed to bring such legislation into line with this Regulation in order to achieve an equivalent level of control.
(13)
Although the supervision and control of shipments of waste within a Member State is a matter for that Member State, national systems concerning shipments of waste should take account of the need for coherence with the Community system in order to ensure a high level of protection of the environment and human health.
(14)
In the case of shipments of waste destined for disposal operations and waste not listed in Annex III, IIIA or IIIB destined for recovery operations, it is appropriate to ensure optimum supervision and control by requiring prior written consent to such shipments. Such a procedure should in turn entail prior notification, which enables the competent authorities to be duly informed so that they can take all necessary measures for the protection of human health and the environment. It should also enable those authorities to raise reasoned objections to such a shipment.
(15)
In the case of shipments of waste listed in Annex III, IIIA or IIIB destined for recovery operations, it is appropriate to ensure a minimum level of supervision and control by requiring such shipments to be accompanied by certain information.
(16)
In view of the need for uniform application of this Regulation and for the proper functioning of the internal market, it is necessary in the interests of efficiency to require that notifications be processed through the competent authority of dispatch.
(17)
It is also important to clarify the system of financial guarantees or equivalent insurance.
(18)
Considering the responsibility of waste producers for the environmentally sound management of waste, the notification and movement documents for waste shipments should, where practicable, be filled in by the waste producers.
(19)
It is necessary to provide procedural safeguards for the notifier, both in the interests of legal certainty and to ensure uniform application of this Regulation and the proper functioning of the internal market.
(20)
In the case of shipments of waste for disposal, Member States should take into account the principles of proximity, priority for recovery and self-sufficiency at Community and national levels, in accordance with Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste (11), by taking measures in accordance with the Treaty to prohibit generally or partially or to object systematically to such shipments. Account should also be taken of the requirement laid down in Directive 2006/12/EC, whereby Member States are to establish an integrated and adequate network of waste disposal installations, in order to enable the Community as a whole to become self-sufficient in waste disposal and the Member States to move towards that aim individually, taking into account geographical circumstances or the need for specialised installations for certain types of waste. Member States should also be able to ensure that the waste management facilities covered by Council Directive 96/61/EC of24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (12) apply best available techniques as defined in that Directive in compliance with the permit of the facility, and that the waste is treated in accordance with legally binding environmental protection standards in relation to disposal operations established in Community legislation.
(21)
In the case of shipments of waste destined for recovery, Member States should be able to ensure that the waste management facilities covered by Directive 96/61/EC apply best available techniques as defined in that Directive in compliance with the permit of the facility. Member States should also be able to ensure that waste is treated in accordance with legally binding environmental protection standards in relation to recovery operations established in Community legislation and that, taking account of Article 7(4) of Directive 2006/12/EC, waste is treated in accordance with waste management plans established pursuant to that Directive with the purpose of ensuring the implementation of legally binding recovery or recycling obligations established in Community legislation.
(22)
The development of mandatory requirements for waste facilities and the treatment of specific waste materials at Community level, in addition to the existing provisions of Community law, can contribute to the creation of a high level of environmental protection across the Community, assist in the creation of a level playing field for recycling and help to ensure that the development of an economically viable internal market for recycling is not hindered. Therefore there is a need to develop a Community level playing field for recycling through the application of common standards in certain areas, as appropriate and including in relation to secondary materials, in order to increase the quality of recycling. The Commission should submit, as appropriate, proposals for such standards for certain wastes and certain recycling facilities as soon as practicable based on further examination in the context of the waste strategy and taking into account existing Community legislation and legislation in the Member States. In the interim, it should be possible, under certain conditions, to object to planned shipments where the related recovery would not be in accordance with national legislation in the country of dispatch relating to the recovery of waste. In the interim, the Commission should also keep under review the situation regarding possible undesired shipments of waste to the new Member States and, if necessary, submit appropriate proposals to deal with such situations.
(23)
Member States should be required to ensure that, in accordance with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters of 25 June 1998 (Aarhus Convention), the relevant competent authorities make publicly available by appropriate means information on notifications of shipments, where such information is not confidential under national or Community legislation.
(24)
An obligation should be laid down to the effect that waste from a shipment that cannot be completed as intended is to be taken back to the country of dispatch or recovered or disposed of in an alternative way.
(25)
It should also be made compulsory for the person whose action is the cause of an illegal shipment to take back the waste involved or make alternative arrangements for its recovery or disposal. Failing that, the competent authorities of dispatch or destination, as appropriate, should intervene themselves.
(26)
It is necessary, in order to protect the environment of the countries concerned, to clarify the scope of the prohibition laid down in accordance with the Basel Convention of exports from the Community of any waste destined for disposal in a third country other than an EFTA (European Free Trade Association) country.
(27)
Countries that are Parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area may adopt the control procedures provided for shipments within the Community.
(28)
It is also necessary, in order to protect the environment of the countries concerned, to clarify the scope of the prohibition of exports of hazardous waste destined for recovery in a country to which the OECD Decision does not apply, also laid down in accordance with the Basel Convention. In particular, it is necessary to clarify the list of waste to which that prohibition applies and to ensure that it also includes the waste listed in Annex II to the Basel Convention, namely waste collected from households and residues from the incineration of household waste.
(29)
Specific arrangements should be maintained for exports of non-hazardous waste destined for recovery in countries to which the OECD Decision does not apply and provision should be made for them to be further streamlined at a later date.
(30)
Imports into the Community of waste for disposal should be permitted where the exporting country is a Party to the Basel Convention. Imports into the Community of waste for recovery should be permitted where the exporting country is one to which the OECD Decision applies or is a Party to the Basel Convention. In other cases, however, imports should be allowed only if the exporting country is bound by a bilateral or multilateral agreement or arrangement compatible with Community legislation and in accordance with Article 11 of the Basel Convention, except when this is not possible during situations of crisis, peacemaking, peacekeeping or war.
(31)
This Regulation should be applied in accordance with international maritime law.
(32)
This Regulation should reflect the rules regarding exports and imports of waste to and from the overseas countries and territories laid down in Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community (Overseas Association Decision) (13).
(33)
The necessary steps should be taken to ensure that, in accordance with Directive 2006/12/EC and other Community legislation on waste, waste shipped within the Community and waste imported into the Community is managed, throughout the period of shipment and including recovery or disposal in the country of destination, without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment. As regards exports from the Community that are not prohibited, efforts should be made to ensure that the waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner throughout the period of shipment and including recovery or disposal in the third country of destination. The facility which receives the waste should be operated in accordance with human health and environmental protection standards that are broadly equivalent to those established in Community legislation. A list of non-binding guidelines should be established in which guidance may be sought on environmentally sound management.
(34)
Member States should provide the Commission with information concerning the implementation of this Regulation, both through the reports submitted to the Secretariat of the Basel Convention and on the basis of a separate questionnaire.
(35)
It is necessary to ensure the safe and environmentally sound management of ship dismantling in order to protect human health and the environment. Furthermore, it should be noted that a ship may become waste as defined in Article 2 of the Basel Convention and that at the same time it may be defined as a ship under other international rules. It is important to recall that work is ongoing, involving inter-agency cooperation between International Labour Organisation (ILO), International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the Secretariat of the Basel Convention, to establish mandatory requirements at the global level ensuring an efficient and effective solution to the problem of ship dismantling.
(36)
Efficient international cooperation regarding control of shipments of waste is instrumental in ensuring that shipments of hazardous waste are controlled. Information exchange, shared responsibility and cooperative efforts between the Community and its Member States and third countries should be promoted with a view to ensuring sound management of waste.
(37)
Certain Annexes to this Regulation should be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(3) of Directive 2006/12/EC. This procedure should also apply to the amendment of the Annexes to take account of scientific and technical progress, of modifications in the relevant Community legislation or of events connected to the OECD Decision or to the Basel Convention and other related international conventions and agreements.
(38)
In preparing the instructions for completing the notification and movement documents to be set out in Annex IC, the Commission, taking into account the OECD Decision and the Basel Convention, should specify, inter alia, that the notification and movement documents should, as far as possible, be on two pages and what the precise timing is for completion of the notification and movement documents in Annex IA and IB, taking into account Annex II. In addition, where terminology and requirements differ between the OECD Decision or the Basel Convention and this Regulation, the specific requirements should be clarified.
(39)
In considering the mixtures of wastes to be added in Annex IIIA, the following information should be considered, inter alia: the properties of the waste, such as its possible hazardous characteristics, its potential for contamination and its physical state; the management aspects, such as the technological capacity to recover the waste, and the environmental benefits arising from the recovery operation, including whether the environmentally sound management of the waste may be impaired. The Commission should progress towards the completion of this Annex as far as possible before the date of entry into force of this Regulation and complete this task at the latest six months after that date.
(40)
Additional measures related to the implementation of this Regulation should also be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(3) of Directive 2006/12/EC. These measures should include a method for calculating the financial guarantee or equivalent insurance to be completed by the Commission, if possible, before the date of application of this Regulation.
(41)
The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (14).
(42)
Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure protection of the environment when waste is subject to shipment, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects thereof, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
TITLE I

TITLE II
SHIPMENTS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WITH OR WITHOUT TRANSIT THROUGH THIRD COUNTRIES

Article 3

Overall procedural framework

1.   Shipments of the following wastes shall be subject to the procedure of prior written notification and consent as laid down in the provisions of this Title:
(a)
if destined for disposal operations:
all wastes;
(b)
if destined for recovery operations:
(i)
wastes listed in Annex IV, which include, inter alia, wastes listed in Annexes II and VIII to the Basel Convention,
(ii)
wastes listed in Annex IVA,
(iii)
wastes not classified under one single entry in either Annex III, IIIB, IV or IVA,
(iv)
mixtures of wastes not classified under one single entry in either Annex III, IIIB, IV or IVA unless listed in Annex IIIA.
2.   Shipments of the following wastes destined for recovery shall be subject to the general information requirements laid down in Article 18, if the amount of waste shipped exceeds 20 kg:
(a)
waste listed in Annex III or IIIB;
(b)
mixtures, not classified under one single entry in Annex III, of two or more wastes listed in Annex III, provided that the composition of these mixtures does not impair their environmentally sound recovery and provided that such mixtures are listed in Annex IIIA, in accordance with Article 58.
3.   For wastes listed in Annex III, in exceptional cases, the relevant provisions shall apply as if they had been listed in Annex IV, if they display any of the hazardous characteristics listed in Annex III to Directive 91/689/EEC. These cases shall be treated in accordance with Article 58.
4.   Shipments of waste explicitly destined for laboratory analysis to assess either its physical or chemical characteristics or to determine its suitability for recovery or disposal operations shall not be subject to the procedure of prior written notification and consent as described in paragraph 1. Instead, the procedural requirements of Article 18 shall apply. The amount of such waste exempted when explicitly destined for laboratory analysis shall be determined by the minimum quantity reasonably needed to adequately perform the analysis in each particular case, and shall not exceed 25 kg.
5.   Shipments of mixed municipal waste (waste entry 20 03 01) collected from private households, including where such collection also covers such waste from other producers, to recovery or disposal facilities shall, in accordance with this Regulation, be subject to the same provisions as shipments of waste destined for disposal.
CHAPTER 1
Prior written notification and consent

Article 4

(a)
costs of transport;
(b)
costs of recovery or disposal, including any necessary interim operation; and
(c)
costs of storage for 90 days.
2.   The financial guarantee or equivalent insurance is intended to cover costs arising in the context of:
(a)
cases where a shipment or the recovery or disposal cannot be completed as intended, as referred to in Article 22; and
(b)
cases where a shipment or the recovery or disposal is illegal as referred to in Article 24.
3.   The financial guarantee or equivalent insurance shall be established by the notifier or by another natural or legal person on its behalf and shall be effective at the time of the notification or, if the competent authority which approves the financial guarantee or equivalent insurance so allows, at the latest when the shipment starts, and shall apply to the notified shipment at the latest when the shipment starts.
4.   The competent authority of dispatch shall approve the financial guarantee or equivalent insurance, including the form, wording and amount of the cover.
However, in cases of import into the Community, the competent authority of destination in the Community shall review the amount of cover and, if necessary, approve an additional financial guarantee or equivalent insurance.
5.   The financial guarantee or equivalent insurance shall be valid for and cover a notified shipment and completion of recovery or disposal of the notified waste.
The financial guarantee or equivalent insurance shall be released when the competent authority concerned has received the certificate referred to in Article 16(e) or, where appropriate, in Article 15(e) as regards interim recovery or disposal operations.
6.   By way of derogation from paragraph 5, if the waste shipped is destined for interim recovery or disposal operations and a further recovery or disposal operation takes place in the country of destination, the financial guarantee or equivalent insurance may be released when the waste leaves the interim facility and the competent authority concerned has received the certificate referred to in Article 15(d). In this case, any further shipment to a recovery or disposal facility shall be covered by a new financial guarantee or equivalent insurance unless the competent authority of destination is satisfied that such a financial guarantee or equivalent insurance is not required. In these circumstances, the competent authority of destination shall be responsible for obligations arising in the case of an illegal shipment or for take-back where the shipment or the further recovery or disposal operation cannot be completed as intended.
7.   The competent authority within the Community which has approved the financial guarantee or equivalent insurance shall have access thereto and shall make use of the funding, including for the purpose of payments to other authorities concerned, in order to meet the obligations arising in accordance with Articles 23 and 25.
8.   In the case of a general notification pursuant to Article 13, a financial guarantee or equivalent insurance covering parts of the general notification may be established, instead of one covering the entire general notification. In such cases, the financial guarantee or equivalent insurance shall apply to the shipment at the latest when the notified shipment it covers starts.
The financial guarantee or equivalent insurance shall be released when the competent authority concerned has received the certificate referred to in Article 16(e) or, where appropriate, in Article 15(e) as regards interim recovery or disposal operations for the relevant waste. Paragraph 6 shall apply mutatis mutandis.
9.   Member States shall inform the Commission of provisions of national law adopted pursuant to this Article.

Article 11

Objections to shipments of waste destined for disposal

1.   Where a notification is submitted regarding a planned shipment of waste destined for disposal, the competent authorities of destination and dispatch may, within 30 days following the date of transmission of the acknowledgement of the competent authority of destination in accordance with Article 8, raise reasoned objections based on one or more of the following grounds and in accordance with the Treaty:
(a)
that the planned shipment or disposal would not be in accordance with measures taken to implement the principles of proximity, priority for recovery and self-sufficiency at Community and national levels in accordance with Directive 2006/12/EC, to prohibit generally or partially or to object systematically to shipments of waste; or
(b)
that the planned shipment or disposal would not be in accordance with national legislation relating to environmental protection, public order, public safety or health protection concerning actions taking place in the objecting country; or
(c)
that the notifier or the consignee has previously been convicted of illegal shipment or some other illegal act in relation to environmental protection. In this case, the competent authorities of dispatch and destination may refuse all shipments involving the person in question in accordance with national legislation; or
(d)
that the notifier or the facility has repeatedly failed to comply with Articles 15 and 16 in connection with past shipments; or
(e)
that the Member State wishes to exercise its right pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Basel Convention to prohibit the import of hazardous waste or of waste listed in Annex II to that Convention; or
(f)
that the planned shipment or disposal conflicts with obligations resulting from international conventions concluded by the Member State(s) concerned or the Community; or
(g)
that the planned shipment or disposal is not in accordance with Directive 2006/12/EC, in particular Articles 5 and 7 thereof, while taking into account geographical circumstances or the need for specialised installations for certain types of waste:
(i)
in order to implement the principle of self-sufficiency at Community and national levels, or
(ii)
in cases where the specialised installation has to dispose of waste from a nearer source and the competent authority has given priority to this waste, or
(iii)
in order to ensure that shipments are in accordance with waste management plans, or
(h)
that the waste will be treated in a facility which is covered by Directive 96/61/EC, but which does not apply best available techniques as defined in Article 9(4) of that Directive in compliance with the permit of the facility; or
(i)
that the waste is mixed municipal waste collected from private households (waste entry 20 03 01); or
(j)
that the waste concerned will not be treated in accordance with legally binding environmental protection standards in relation to disposal operations established in Community legislation (also in cases where temporary derogations are granted).
2.   The competent authority(ies) of transit may, within the 30-day time limit referred to in paragraph 1, raise reasoned objections based only on paragraph 1(b), (c), (d) and (f).
3.   In the case of hazardous waste produced in a Member State of dispatch in such a small quantity overall per year that the provision of new specialised disposal installations within that Member State would be uneconomic, paragraph 1(a) shall not apply.
The competent authority of destination shall cooperate with the competent authority of dispatch which considers that this paragraph and not paragraph 1(a) should apply, with a view to resolving the issue bilaterally.
If there is no satisfactory solution, either Member State may refer the matter to the Commission. The Commission shall then determine the issue in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(3) of Directive 2006/12/EC.
4.   If, within the 30-day time limit referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities consider that the problems which gave rise to their objections have been resolved, they shall immediately inform the notifier in writing, with copies to the consignee and to the other competent authorities concerned.
5.   If the problems giving rise to the objections have not been resolved within the 30-day time limit referred to in paragraph 1, the notification shall cease to be valid. In cases where the notifier still intends to carry out the shipment, a new notification shall be submitted, unless all the competent authorities concerned and the notifier agree otherwise.
6.   Measures taken by Member States in accordance with paragraph 1(a), to prohibit generally or partially or to object systematically to shipments of waste destined for disposal, or in accordance with paragraph 1(e), shall immediately be notified to the Commission which shall inform the other Member States.
Article 12

Objections to shipments of waste destined for recovery

1.   Where a notification is submitted regarding a planned shipment of waste destined for recovery, the competent authorities of destination and dispatch may, within 30 days following the date of transmission of the acknowledgement of the competent authority of destination in accordance with Article 8, raise reasoned objections based on one or more of the following grounds and in accordance with the Treaty:
(a)
that the planned shipment or recovery would not be in accordance with Directive 2006/12/EC, in particular Articles 3, 4, 7 and 10 thereof; or
(b)
that the planned shipment or recovery would not be in accordance with national legislation relating to environmental protection, public order, public safety or health protection concerning actions taking place in the objecting country; or
(c)
that the planned shipment or recovery would not be in accordance with national legislation in the country of dispatch relating to the recovery of waste, including where the planned shipment would concern waste destined for recovery in a facility which has lower treatment standards for the particular waste than those of the country of dispatch, respecting the need to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market;
This shall not apply if:
(i)
there is corresponding Community legislation, in particular related to waste, and if requirements that are at least as stringent as those laid down in the Community legislation have been introduced in national legislation transposing such Community legislation,
(ii)
the recovery operation in the country of destination takes place under conditions that are broadly equivalent to those prescribed in the national legislation of the country of dispatch,
(iii)
the national legislation in the country of dispatch, other than that covered by (i), has not been notified in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (19), where required by that Directive, or
(d)
that the notifier or the consignee has previously been convicted of illegal shipment or some other illegal act in relation to environmental protection. In this case, the competent authorities of dispatch and destination may refuse all shipments involving the person in question in accordance with national legislation; or
(e)
that the notifier or the facility has repeatedly failed to comply with Articles 15 and 16 in connection with past shipments; or
(f)
that the planned shipment or recovery conflicts with obligations resulting from international conventions concluded by the Member State(s) concerned or the Community; or
(g)
that the ratio of the recoverable and non-recoverable waste, the estimated value of the materials to be finally recovered or the cost of the recovery and the cost of the disposal of the non-recoverable fraction do not justify the recovery, having regard to economic and/or environmental considerations; or
(h)
that the waste shipped is destined for disposal and not for recovery; or
(i)
that the waste will be treated in a facility which is covered by Directive 96/61/EC, but which does not apply best available techniques as defined in Article 9(4) of that Directive in compliance with the permit of the facility; or
(j)
that the waste concerned will not be treated in accordance with legally binding environmental protection standards in relation to recovery operations, or legally binding recovery or recycling obligations established in Community legislation (also in cases where temporary derogations are granted); or
(k)
that the waste concerned will not be treated in accordance with waste management plans drawn up pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 2006/12/EC with the purpose of ensuring the implementation of legally binding recovery or recycling obligations established in Community legislation.
2.   The competent authority(ies) of transit may, within the 30-day time limit referred to in paragraph 1, raise reasoned objections to the planned shipment based only on paragraph 1(b), (d), (e) and (f).
3.   If, within the 30-day time limit referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities consider that the problems which gave rise to their objections have been resolved, they shall immediately inform the notifier in writing, with copies to the consignee and to the other competent authorities concerned.
4.   If the problems giving rise to the objections are not resolved within the 30-day time limit referred to in paragraph 1, the notification shall cease to be valid. In cases where the notifier still intends to carry out the shipment, a new notification shall be submitted, unless all the competent authorities concerned and the notifier agree otherwise.
5.   Objections raised by competent authorities in accordance with paragraph 1(c) shall be reported by Member States to the Commission in accordance with Article 51.
6.   The Member State of dispatch shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the national legislation on which objections raised by competent authorities in accordance with paragraph 1(c) may be based, and shall state to which waste and waste recovery operations those objections apply, before such legislation is invoked in order to raise reasoned objections.
Article 13

General notification

1.   The notifier may submit a general notification to cover several shipments if, in the case of each shipment:
(a)
the waste has essentially similar physical and chemical characteristics; and
(b)
the waste is shipped to the same consignee and the same facility; and
(c)
the route of the shipment as indicated in the notification document is the same.
2.   If, owing to unforeseen circumstances, the same route cannot be followed, the notifier shall inform the competent authorities concerned as soon as possible and, if possible, before the shipment starts if the need for modification is already known.
Where the route modification is known before the shipment starts and involves competent authorities other than those concerned by the general notification, the general notification may not be used and a new notification shall be submitted.

CHAPTER 4
Take-back obligations

Article 22

Take-back when a shipment cannot be completed as intended

1.   Where any of the competent authorities concerned becomes aware that a shipment of waste, including its recovery or disposal, cannot be completed as intended in accordance with the terms of the notification and movement documents and/or contract referred to in the second subparagraph, point 4 of Article 4 and in Article 5, it shall immediately inform the competent authority of dispatch. Where a recovery or disposal facility rejects a shipment received, it shall immediately inform the competent authority of destination.
2.   The competent authority of dispatch shall ensure that, except in cases referred to in paragraph 3, the waste in question is taken back to its area of jurisdiction or elsewhere within the country of dispatch by the notifier as identified in accordance with the ranking established in point 15 of Article 2, or, if impracticable, by that competent authority itself or by a natural or legal person on its behalf.
This shall take place within 90 days, or such other period as may be agreed between the competent authorities concerned, after the competent authority of dispatch becomes aware or has been advised in writing by the competent authorities of destination or transit that the consented shipment of waste or its recovery or disposal cannot be completed and has been informed of the reason(s) therefor. Such advice may result from information submitted to the competent authorities of destination or transit, inter alia, by other competent authorities.
3.   The take-back obligation in paragraph 2 shall not apply if the competent authorities of dispatch, transit and destination involved in disposing of or recovering the waste are satisfied that the waste can be recovered or disposed of in an alternative way in the country of destination or elsewhere by the notifier or, if impracticable, by the competent authority of dispatch or by a natural or legal person on its behalf.
The take-back obligation in paragraph 2 shall not apply if the waste shipped has, in the course of the operation at the facility concerned, been irreversibly mixed with other waste before a competent authority concerned has become aware of the fact that the notified shipment cannot be completed as referred to in paragraph 1. Such mixture shall be recovered or disposed of in an alternative way in accordance with the first subparagraph.
4.   In cases of take-back as referred to in paragraph 2, a new notification shall be submitted, unless the competent authorities concerned agree that a duly reasoned request by the initial competent authority of dispatch is sufficient.
A new notification, where appropriate, shall be submitted by the initial notifier or, if impracticable, by any other natural or legal persons identified in accordance with point 15 of Article 2, or, if impracticable, by the initial competent authority of dispatch or by a natural or legal person on its behalf.
No competent authority shall oppose or object to the return of waste from a shipment that cannot be completed or to the related recovery and disposal operation.
5.   In cases of alternative arrangements outside the initial country of destination as referred to in paragraph 3, a new notification, where appropriate, shall be submitted by the initial notifier or, if impracticable, by any other natural or legal persons identified in accordance with point 15 of Article 2, or, if impracticable, by the initial competent authority of dispatch or by a natural or legal person on its behalf.
When such a new notification is submitted by the notifier, this notification shall also be submitted to the competent authority of the initial country of dispatch.
6.   In cases of alternative arrangements in the initial country of destination as referred to in paragraph 3, a new notification shall not be required and a duly reasoned request shall suffice. Such a duly reasoned request, seeking agreement to the alternative arrangement, shall be transmitted to the competent authority of destination and dispatch by the initial notifier or, if impracticable, to the competent authority of destination by the initial competent authority of dispatch.
7.   If no new notification is to be submitted in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 6, a new movement document shall be completed in accordance with Article 15 or Article 16 by the initial notifier or, if impracticable, by any other natural or legal persons identified in accordance with point 15 of Article 2, or, if impracticable, by the initial competent authority of dispatch or by a natural or legal person on its behalf.
If a new notification is submitted by the initial competent authority of dispatch in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 5, a new financial guarantee or equivalent insurance shall not be required.
8.   The obligation of the notifier and the subsidiary obligation of the country of dispatch to take the waste back or arrange for alternative recovery or disposal shall end when the facility issues the certificate of non-interim recovery or disposal as referred to in Article 16(e) or, where appropriate, in Article 15(e). In the cases of interim recovery or disposal referred to in Article 6(6), the subsidiary obligation of the country of dispatch shall end when the facility issues the certificate referred to in Article 15(d).
If a facility issues a certificate of recovery or disposal in such a way as to result in an illegal shipment, with the consequence that the financial guarantee is released, Article 24(3) and Article 25(2) shall apply.
9.   Where waste from a shipment which cannot be completed, including its recovery or disposal, is discovered within a Member State, the competent authority with jurisdiction over the area where the waste was discovered shall be responsible for ensuring that arrangements are made for the safe storage of the waste pending its return or non-interim recovery or disposal in an alternative way.

taken back by the notifier de jure; or, if impracticable;
(c)
taken back by the competent authority of dispatch itself or by a natural or legal person on its behalf; or, if impracticable;

alternatively recovered or disposed of in another country by the competent authority of dispatch itself or by a natural or legal person on its behalf if all the competent authorities concerned agree.
This take-back, recovery or disposal shall take place within 30 days, or such other period as may be agreed between the competent authorities concerned after the competent authority of dispatch becomes aware of or has been advised in writing by the competent authorities of destination or transit of the illegal shipment and informed of the reason(s) therefor. Such advice may result from information submitted to the competent authorities of destination or transit, inter alia, by other competent authorities.
In cases of take-back as referred to in (a), (b) and (c), a new notification shall be submitted, unless the competent authorities concerned agree that a duly reasoned request by the initial competent authority of dispatch is sufficient.
The new notification shall be submitted by the person or authority listed in (a), (b) or (c) and in accordance with that order.
No competent authority shall oppose or object to the return of waste of an illegal shipment. In the case of alternative arrangements as referred to in (d) and (e) by the competent authority of dispatch, a new notification shall be submitted by the initial competent authority of dispatch or by a natural or legal person on its behalf unless the competent authorities concerned agree that a duly reasoned request by that authority is sufficient.
3.   If an illegal shipment is the responsibility of the consignee the competent authority of destination shall ensure that the waste in question is recovered or disposed of in an environmentally sound manner:
(a)
by the consignee; or, if impracticable,
(b)
by the competent authority itself or by a natural or legal person on its behalf.
This recovery or disposal shall take place within 30 days, or such other period as may be agreed between the competent authorities concerned after the competent authority of destination becomes aware of or has been advised in writing by the competent authorities of dispatch or transit of the illegal shipment and informed of the reason(s) therefor. Such advice may result from information submitted to the competent authorities of dispatch and transit, inter alia, by other competent authorities.
To this end, the competent authorities concerned shall cooperate, as necessary, in the recovery or disposal of the waste.
4.   If no new notification is to be submitted, a new movement document shall be completed in accordance with Article 15 or 16 by the person responsible for take-back or, if impracticable, by the initial competent authority of dispatch.
If a new notification is submitted by the initial competent authority of dispatch, a new financial guarantee or equivalent insurance shall not be required.
5.   In particular in cases where responsibility for the illegal shipment cannot be imputed to either the notifier or the consignee, the competent authorities concerned shall cooperate to ensure that the waste in question is recovered or disposed of.
6.   In the cases of interim recovery or disposal referred to in Article 6(6) where an illegal shipment is discovered after completion of the interim recovery or disposal operation, the subsidiary obligation of the country of dispatch to take the waste back or arrange for alternative recovery or disposal shall end when the facility has issued the certificate referred to in Article 15(d).
If a facility issues a certificate of recovery or disposal in such a way as to result in an illegal shipment, with the consequence that the financial guarantee is released, paragraph 3 and Article 25(2) shall apply.
7.   Where the waste of an illegal shipment is discovered within a Member State, the competent authority with jurisdiction over the area where the waste was discovered shall be responsible for ensuring that arrangements are made for the safe storage of the waste pending its return or non-interim recovery or disposal in an alternative way.
8.   Articles 34 and 36 shall not apply in cases where illegal shipments are returned to the country of dispatch and that country of dispatch is a country covered by the prohibitions set out in those Articles.
9.   In the case of an illegal shipment as defined in point 35(g) of Article 2, the person who arranges the shipment shall be subject to the same obligations established in this Article as the notifier.

(a)
wastes listed as hazardous in Annex V;
(b)
wastes listed in Annex V, Part 3;
(c)
hazardous wastes not classified under one single entry in Annex V;
(d)
mixtures of hazardous wastes and mixtures of hazardous wastes with non-hazardous wastes not classified under one single entry in Annex V;
(e)
wastes that the country of destination has notified to be hazardous under Article 3 of the Basel Convention;

2.   This provision shall be without prejudice to the take-back obligations as set out in Articles 22 and 24.
3.   Member States may, in exceptional cases, adopt provisions to determine, on the basis of documentary evidence provided in an appropriate way by the notifier, that a specific hazardous waste listed in Annex V is excluded from the export prohibition if it does not display any of the properties listed in Annex III to Directive 91/689/EEC, taking into account, as regards the properties H3 to H8, H10 and H11 defined in that Annex, the limit values laid down in Commission Decision 2000/532/EC of 3 May 2000 replacing Decision 94/3/EC establishing a list of wastes pursuant to Article 1(a) of Council Directive 75/442/EEC on waste and Council Decision 94/904/EC establishing a list of hazardous waste pursuant to Article 1(4) of Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste (21).
4.   The fact that waste is not listed as hazardous in Annex V, or that it is listed in Annex V, Part 1, List B, shall not preclude, in exceptional cases, characterisation of such waste as hazardous and therefore subject to the export prohibition if it displays any of the properties listed in Annex III to Directive 91/689/EEC, taking into account, as regards the properties H3 to H8, H10 and H11 defined in that Annex, the limit values laid down in Commission Decision 2000/532/EC, as provided for in Article 1(4), second indent, of Directive 91/689/EEC and in the introductory paragraph of Annex III to this Regulation.
5.   In the cases referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, the Member State concerned shall inform the envisaged country of destination prior to taking a decision. Member States shall notify such cases to the Commission before the end of each calendar year. The Commission shall forward the information to all Member States and to the Secretariat of the Basel Convention. On the basis of the information provided, the Commission may make comments and, where appropriate, adapt Annex V in accordance with Article 58.

1.   In the case of waste which is listed in Annex III or IIIA and the export of which is not prohibited under Article 36, the Commission shall, within 20 days of the entry into force of this Regulation, send a written request to each country to which the OECD Decision does not apply, seeking:
(i)
confirmation in writing that the waste may be exported from the Community for recovery in that country, and
(ii)
an indication as to which control procedure, if any, would be followed in the country of destination.
Each country to which the OECD Decision does not apply shall be given the following options:
(a)
a prohibition; or

The Commission shall periodically update the Regulation adopted.
3.   If a country indicates in its reply that certain shipments of waste are not subject to any control, Article 18 shall apply mutatis mutandis to such shipments.
4.   Where waste is exported, it shall be destined for recovery operations within a facility which, under applicable national law, is operating or is authorised to operate in the country of destination.
5.   In the case of a shipment of waste not classified under one single entry in Annex III or a shipment of mixtures of wastes not classified under one single entry in Annex III or IIIA or a shipment of waste classified in Annex IIIB, and provided that the export is not prohibited pursuant to Article 36, paragraph 1(b) of this Article shall apply.

ANNEX IVA

WASTE LISTED IN ANNEX III BUT SUBJECT TO THE PROCEDURE OF PRIOR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION AND CONSENT (ARTICLE 3(3))

ANNEX V

WASTE SUBJECT TO THE EXPORT PROHIBITION IN ARTICLE 36

Introductory notes

1.
This Annex applies without prejudice to Directives 91/689/EEC and 2006/12/EC.
2.
This Annex consists of three parts, Parts 2 and 3 of which apply only when Part 1 is not applicable. Consequently, to determine whether a specific waste is listed in this Annex, an initial check must be made to ascertain whether the waste is listed in Part 1 of this Annex, and, if it does not, whether it is listed in Part 2, and, if it does not, whether it is listed in Part 3.
Part 1 is divided into two sub-sections: List A lists wastes which are classified as hazardous by Article 1(1)(a) of the Basel Convention, and therefore covered by the export prohibition, and List B lists wastes which are not covered by Article 1(1)(a) of the Basel Convention, and therefore not covered by the export prohibition.
Thus, if a waste is listed in Part 1, a check must be made to ascertain whether it is listed in List A or in List B. Only if a waste is not listed in either List A or List B of Part 1, must a check be made to ascertain whether it is listed either among the hazardous waste listed in Part 2 (i.e. types of waste marked with an asterisk) or in Part 3, and if this is the case, it is covered by the export prohibition.
3.

(1)  References in Lists A and B to Annexes I, III and IV refer to Annexes of the Basel Convention.
(2)  Note that mirror entry on list B (B1160) does not specify exceptions.
(3)  This entry does not include scrap assemblies from electric power generation.
(4)  PCBs are at a concentration level of 50 mg/kg or more.
(5)  PCBs at a concentration level of 50mg/kg or more.
(6)  The 50 mg/kg level is considered to be an internationally practical level for all wastes. However, many individual countries have established lower regulatory levels (e.g. 20 mg/kg) for specific wastes.
(7)   ‘Out-dated’ means unused within the period recommended by the manufacturer.
(8)  This entry does not include wood treated with wood-preserving chemicals.
(9)   ‘Out-dated’ means unused within the period recommended by the manufacturer.
(10)  Note that even where low level contamination with Annex I materials initially exists, subsequent processes, including recycling processes, may result in separated fractions containing significantly enhanced concentrations of those Annex I materials.
(11)  The status of zinc ash is currently under review and there is a recommendation with United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) that zinc ashes should not be dangerous goods.
(12)  This entry does not include scrap from electrical power generation.
(13)  Re-use can include repair, refurbishment or upgrading, but not major reassembly.
(14)  In some countries these materials destined for direct re-use are not considered wastes.
(15)  The concentration level of Benzol[a]pyrene should not be 50mg/kg or more.
(16)  It is understood that such scraps are completely polymerised.
(17)  
—
Post-consumer wastes are excluded from this entry.
—
Wastes shall not be mixed.
—
Problems arising from open-burning practices to be considered.
(18)  Wastes marked with an asterisk are considered to be hazardous waste pursuant to Directive 91/689/EEC. When identifying a waste in the list below, the introduction to the Annex of Decision 2000/532/EC is relevant.
(19)  For the purpose of this list of wastes, PCBs will be defined as in Council Directive 96/59/EC of 16 September 1996 on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCB/PCT) (OJ L 243, 24.9.1996, p. 31).
(20)  Hazardous components from electrical and electronic equipment may include accumulators and batteries mentioned in 16 06 and marked as hazardous, mercury switches, glass from cathode ray tubes and other activated glass etc.
(21)  For the purpose of this entry, transition metals are: scandium, vanadium, manganese, cobalt, copper, yttrium, niobium, hafnium, tungsten, titanium, chromium, iron, nickel, zinc, zirconium, molybdenum and tantalum. These metals or their compounds are dangerous if they are classified as dangerous substances. The classification of dangerous substances shall determine which among those transition metals and which transition metal compounds are hazardous.
(22)  Stabilisation processes change the dangerousness of the constituents in the waste and thus transform hazardous waste into non-hazardous waste. Solidification processes only change the physical state of the waste (e.g. liquid into solid) by using additives without changing the chemical properties of the waste.
(23)  A waste is considered as partly stabilised if after the stabilisation process dangerous constituents which have not been changed completely into non-dangerous constituents could be released into the environment in the short, middle or long term.
(24)  Hazardous components from electrical and electronic equipment may include accumulators and batteries mentioned in 16 06 and marked as hazardous, mercury switches, glass from cathode ray tubes and other activated glass, etc.
(25)  This list originates from Appendix 4, Part I of the OECD Decision.
(26)  Unless appropriately classified under a single entry in Annex III.
(27)  The wastes numbered AB130, AC250, AC260 and AC270 have been deleted since they have been considered, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste (OJ L 194, 25.7.1975, p. 39. Directive as repealed by Directive 2006/12/EC), to be non-hazardous and therefore not subject to the export prohibition laid down in Article 35 of this Regulation.
(28)  This listing includes wastes in the form of ash, residue, slag, dross, skimming, scaling, dust, powder, sludge and cake, unless a material is expressly listed elsewhere.
